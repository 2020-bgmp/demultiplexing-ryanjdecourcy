II) What is a good quality score cutoff for index reads and biological read pairs to 
utilize for sample identification and downstream analysis, respectively?
 Justify your answer.

Index pairs - The index pairs should be held to a higher quality standard for sample identification than the 
biological read pairs - 37, would be a good cutoff. We know what their sequence is, inherently, so they should be 
held to a higher quality standard than the biological read pairs.
They are, however, long enough indexes, that it is highly unlikely to get a random match (4^8) - so it may also be good practice to 
to keep indexes that match perfectly regardless of low q-scores. Given what was being sequenced, and the cost of sequencing,
being more liberal with quality cut-off and less selective with what is kept - with regard to index selection - might be good.


Read pairs - Selecting a cut-off of around 33 for the average of a single read would be a good q-score to aim for.
Removing reads that have averages below that would be a decent idea. This way, many reads are kept (given the cost of
sequencing, this is a good idea) - it is a good idea, given that there is a depth to sequencing over this genome. Errors can be
corrected at a later point in time.

A second method - given a larger amount of funding and resources:
Around 30 would be a good quality score for read pairs - It would cut
most all the low quality-score reads from the sequencing. A good way to do this would be to look at an individual
read out of the large set, and if one of the nucleotides sequenced in that position is below the q-score, then remove that read.
